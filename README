Manual

In order to run the experiments you should follow these steps:

0. Create and activate a virtual environment and then run the command
pip3 install -r requirements.txt in order to install the necessary
libraries in order to run the code

1. Unzip the imdb.zip. In this file there is contained the
IMDb reviews dataset.

2. For Machine Learning Experiments run the ./code/ml_approach.py
using Python3.

3. For LSTM experiments you can either run the ./code/lstm_experiments.sh
script that runs the Grid Search I present on this report or the
./code/lstm_approach.py script in order to run a single experiment. You can
add the parameter -h in order to get the usage of that file.

4. For BERT experiments you can either run the ./code/bert_experiments.sh
script that runs the Grid Search I present on this report or the
./code/bert_approach.py script in order to run a single experiment. You can
add the parameter -h in order to get the usage of that file.

5. In the ./code/{bert|lstm}_logs directories contain the output of each experiment.
